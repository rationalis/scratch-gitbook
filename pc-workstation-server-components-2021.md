# PC / Workstation / Server Components 2021

Supply for parts is lower than demand as a result of underprovisioning for COVID, it's insanely hard to find current-gen higher-end CPUs/GPUs.

* CPU
  * AMD 5950X: flagship desktop CPU, 4th gen Ryzen
    * best single-core performance line + 16 cores
  * AMD 3995WX: flagship workstation CPU, 3rd gen Threadripper Pro
    * 64 cores, lots of PCIe lanes, supports more RAM
  * 4th gen Threadripper CPUs are TBA
  * 5th gen Ryzen is probably going to be releasing in 2022, rumored to have similar if not greater IPC increase as 4th gen did \(coming from 3rd gen\), in addition to higher clock speeds due to 5nm process
  * Note that "Zen 4" is "5th gen" because they had "Zen+" as 2nd gen
  * Intel in 2021 LOL
* RAM
  * DDR5 Coming Soon^TM
    * mayyyyybe 2022?

  * DDR4 DRAM is currently relatively affordable, so it's worth considering to invest in workstation grade parts and getting as much as 256GB of RAM
* Non-volatile storage
  * Samsung 980 Pro: NVMe, PCIe 4.0, still the gold standard of flagship SSDs
  * Intel P5800X: 2nd gen Optane, PCIe 4.0
    * much higher write endurance, lower latencies, higher random IOPS, compared to SSDs
* GPUs
  * Still all Nvidia
  * 3090 is the Big Boy \(equivalent to past Titans\) with 24GB of VRAM
  * 3080 is the usual

External / peripherals:

* Keyboards
  * Dactyl Manuform: [https://github.com/abstracthat/dactyl-manuform](https://github.com/abstracthat/dactyl-manuform)
  * DMOTE: Dactyl with a different thumb cluster design
* Displays
  * Samsung Odyssey G9: 49", \(Mega-?\) Ultrawide \(32:9\), 240Hz, 1440p, QLED, equivalent to 2 27" monitors
    * Soon to receive a refresh this year adding mini LED, which may improve brightness, contrast \(HDR\), response times
  * LG CX 48 OLED: technically a TV, 4K 120Hz
* Eye tracker
  * Tobii Eye Tracker 5

Way out stuff to keep an eye on:

* Universal memory candidates: NRAM \(Nantero\), memristors
* MicroLEDs: they exist but are super expensive and still not miniaturized, $100k 77" TVs - but essentially provide all the benefits of LEDs without the downsides of OLED \(burn in, ghosting\)
